    <p>This website aims to be a valuable digital supplement to the study of the “Periplus Maris Erythraei.” By providing detailed information on each site and its location, as well as original maps, this website creates digital experiences of the spatial information given in this 2nd c. CE book. The focus is to create a centralized digital space where one can engage with the text and the sites there described and the scholarship on such sites.</p>

<p>The digital material provided in this website includes a gazetteer of the Periplus, with essential information for every site described in the text, and maps built using QGIS.</p>

<h3 id="centered-around-the-periplus-maris-erythraei">Centered around the Periplus Maris Erythraei</h3>
<p>The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea is a very valuable text for the study of Indo-Mediterranean maritime trade. Written in 2nd c. CE in Greek for investors in trade and potentially merchants. It describes the sites that merchants encountered while navigating the Eastern and Western trade routes in the Erythrean Sea, as well as the products imported and exported, and at times produced in each sites. Descriptions of the coast highlight the relationship between inland markets and coastal markets, as well as the role that local polities played.</p>

<p>The order in which the text presents the sites is particularly important, for it follows the order that merchants would have taken while navigating respectively the Western route, from Muos Hormos to Rhapta, and the Eastern route, from Leukē Kōmē to Thina.</p>

<p>In this website I want to focus specifically on the determination of space and place, as reflected within this text.</p>
<ul>
  <li>My goal is to create digital experiences of the spatial information given in the Periplus Maris Erythraei, primarily in an effort to supplement the study of the text</li>
  <li>Especially as there are many attempts to identify the sites here the describe and often scholars are disagreed on their location and identification
      § Value in creating an easily queryable database and to generate a nice website on the basis of a column based dataset that would be oriented to navigating this specific aspect of the text</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="users-guide">User’s guide</h3>
<p>The user can engage with both a gazetteer built using a relational database and original maps constructed with QGIS of the places of the Periplus.</p>
<ul>
  <li>By navigating to “Sites” they will be directed to a list of topographical information for each site; by clicking on each site, the user will be presented with the following info: ancient toponym, location accuracy, location source,	pleiades ID (if applicable), the route, the site	next on route, the site’s place type,	the name of ancient area it was located in, and finally the chapter number of the Periplus that describes this site.</li>
  <li>By navigating to “Mapping the Periplus” the user will be presented with a series of original maps built with QGIS that engage with various spatial aspects of the sites described in the text.</li>
</ul>
